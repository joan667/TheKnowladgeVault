> *"A repo to keep track of things i learned"*

## 📘 Overview

**The Knowledge Vault** is a personal knowledge repository designed to centralize everything I learn about **computer science, programming, and technology**.  
It serves as both a reference hub and a learning log — a place to store the insights, experiments, and lessons gathered through hands-on exploration.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to **condense practical knowledge** gained while exploring different areas of tech, using a *learn-by-doing* methodology.  
Each topic or subfolder represents a technology, concept, or project that I’ve studied, tested, and implemented in practice.

This approach ensures that learning is not just theoretical but supported by experimentation, small projects, and real-world examples.

## 🧩 Structure

This repository is organized into different folders, each representing a topic or area of knowledge that I am currently learning, have explored, or plan to study in the future.  

> ⚠️ Note: Some topics may not be fully polished or even particularly useful — I am often a beginner (*newbie*) in certain areas. The goal is to document learning, experiments, and progress, rather than present finalized expertise.

Each folder may contain:
- Notes and explanations in Markdown  
- Code samples and mini-projects  
- References, links, or resources that helped me understand the topic

## 🧭 Philosophy

> “Knowledge that isn’t applied fades away.”

**The Knowledge Vault** isn’t meant to be perfect or complete — it’s a living archive that grows with every new thing learned, tested, or broken along the way.  
It’s about documenting *progress*, not *perfection*.

## 🚀 How to Use

If you find something useful here:
1. Explore the folders by topic.  
2. Read through the notes or code snippets.  
3. Feel free to fork, experiment, and build upon them.
