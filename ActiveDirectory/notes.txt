What is Active Directory?

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is used to organize, manage, and secure the resources of a network, such as users, computers, printers, and other devices. Think of it as a central database that stores information about everything in a network and controls access to those resources.

Key points about Active Directory:

 - Centralized Management: AD allows administrators to manage users, groups, and devices from a single location. For example, you can create a user account and automatically grant access to network resources.

 - Authentication and Authorization: AD verifies (authenticates) the identity of users when they log in and determines what resources they can access (authorization).

 - Hierarchical Structure: AD uses a hierarchical structure that includes:

    - Domains: The main organizational unit.

    - Organizational Units (OUs): Subdivisions within a domain for easier management.

    - Trees and Forests: Collections of domains that form a network-wide structure.

    - Group Policies: AD allows administrators to enforce rules and settings across users and computers, like password complexity requirements or software installation policies.

What is a domain controller?

A Domain Controller is a server in an Active Directory environment that stores the Active Directory database and manages all security-related aspects of a domain. Its main responsibilities include:

 - Authentication: Verifying the identity of users and computers when they log in.

 - Authorization: Determining what resources users or computers can access.

 - Policy Enforcement: Applying Group Policies across users and computers.

 - Replication: Keeping the Active Directory database synchronized across multiple DCs in the domain.

In short, the Domain Controller acts as the “gatekeeper” and central manager of the domain.
